## Privacy Policy

Here at Curtious Creations, we take privacy very seriously and want to be as transparent as possible about our usage of users' sensitive data.
 
 Curtious Creations may request​ access to sensitive data such as contact or device information.
 This data is only kept locally and is never exported or shared.
​
Some Curtious Creations services require internet communication. In such cases, communication / data is sent through Google's Firebase Service and is End to End encrypted. Each user is only allowed to access their own data.  Curtious Creations does not see or use this data in any way outside of the realm of the functionality of the app. 
 
Each app that Curtious Creations publishes may use any combination of specific permissions such as SMS, Contacts, Location, etc. These permissions are use-case specific, but Curtious Creations  will never use these permissions outside the realm of the functionality of the app.​
